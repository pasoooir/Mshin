## Browser 50-stage edition

- Main entry: `index.html`; runtime: `src/web-game.js`; audio module: `src/audio.js`.
- 10 themed worlds, 5 stages per world, 5 route styles, world-specific trackside scenery, hazard silhouettes and handling grip.
- World/stage selection, five-car garage (three starters plus two coin unlocks), per-car engine/grip/nitro workshop upgrades, first-clear/replay coin rewards with placement bonuses, five persistent milestone achievements with one-time bonuses, three AI rivals, live race ranking, track minimap, ten world-specific weather profiles and weather-dependent handling, keyboard steering, touch joystick/pedals/nitro, collectible nitro boost, 3-lap race flow, pause/finish, local completion and best-time records.
- Audio is generated through the Web Audio API without downloaded audio assets or third-party runtime dependencies. AudioContext initializes after user interaction; mute/unmute is available in the HUD.
- No third-party runtime dependencies; progress and settings are stored locally in the browser. The deployed versioned service worker (`mshin-arcade-v4`) caches the app shell and refreshes old caches so returning offline users receive the current gameplay after deployment.
- Automated Chromium tests exercise desktop and mobile menu-to-race flow and save `mshin-gameplay-desktop.png` and `mshin-gameplay-mobile.png` as the `mshin-gameplay-previews` workflow artifact. Full race completion, performance on low-end Android, touch gesture ergonomics, audio hardware compatibility, and art quality remain to be tuned.

## Cocos build feasibility and external gates

The inspected development runner has no Cocos Creator/Dashboard, Android SDK/NDK, `adb`, `sdkmanager`, `avdmanager` or Gradle. Official Creator 3.8 command-line publishing still requires an installed Creator GUI environment. Do not fabricate `.scene` files or claim Creator build/device QA based on Node tests.

External environment needed: a desktop with Cocos Creator 3.8.6 installed and opened, plus Android build dependencies and a physical device/emulator for APK/AAB and touch/orientation verification.

## Cloudflare boundary

`workers.js` exposes health/config and CORS preflight only. It is stateless, has no player-data persistence/leaderboard, and is not deployed or connected to the browser client. No R2/D1/KV/DO bindings or paid services are configured.


## Newly requested gameplay backlog — next priority

These items are planned work, not yet implemented or accepted. They are ordered so that traffic behavior and physically credible collision response are established before the final destruction effects.

| Priority | Work item | Status | Acceptance criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | Intelligent, continuously moving nearby traffic (browser + Cocos AI foundation) | 🟢 تکمیل‌شده و تأییدشده | Rival/traffic cars maintain independent speed and progress, continuously steer, change lanes/route position, anticipate bends, keep safe following gaps, overtake when safe, and react to the player and other traffic. Motion must not look like cars sliding on fixed rails or teleporting between lanes. |
| P1 | Rear-end impact momentum transfer | ⬜ شروع‌نشده | When a rear car hits the car ahead, the front car receives a visible forward impulse and accelerates/gets displaced forward according to mass, closing speed, restitution and contact point. The rear car loses speed and may yaw/drift; momentum and energy behavior remain bounded and deterministic. Add chain-collision tests for multiple cars. |
| P2 | Progressive blackened paint after repeated impacts (browser) | 🟢 تکمیل‌شده و تأییدشده | Each new impact increases localized soot, scorch and paint-darkening on the struck panels. Damage accumulates per vehicle and per panel; one small touch must not instantly turn the whole car black. |
| P2 | Dense black smoke from heavily damaged front/engine area (browser) | 🟢 تکمیل‌شده و تأییدشده | Smoke starts subtle, becomes darker/denser with accumulated engine/front damage, rises and trails with vehicle motion/wind, and remains attached to the correct vehicle. |
| P2 | Fire and explosion at critical damage (browser) | 🟢 تکمیل‌شده و تأییدشده | Critical cumulative damage triggers a staged sequence: sparks/heat → visible flames → one controlled explosion with particles, flash, sound and camera response. Trigger once only; avoid repeated explosion loops. |
| P2 | Burn-out and vehicle removal (browser) | 🟢 تکمیل‌شده و تأییدشده | After the explosion, the wreck continues burning briefly, emits fading black smoke, then fades/shrinks and is removed from active traffic/collision/ranking safely. Player vehicle must use a clear race-over/recovery flow rather than silently disappearing. |
| P1 | Collision and destruction regression suite (browser integration + desktop/mobile smoke) | 🟢 تکمیل‌شده و تأییدشده | Automated tests cover impulse transfer, mass differences, off-centre yaw, repeated-hit damage accumulation, smoke/fire thresholds, one-shot explosion, burn duration, despawn cleanup, and no ghost collisions after removal. Desktop and mobile gameplay previews must show the complete sequence. |

**Implementation notes:** use the existing rigid-body/impulse and localized damage foundations rather than scripted teleportation. Keep browser and Cocos behavior aligned where each runtime is supported. Tune thresholds for readable arcade gameplay while preserving physically plausible direction and relative response. Treat smoke, flames and debris as pooled effects so repeated traffic collisions do not create unbounded per-frame allocations. The browser edition is released as 0.8.0 (PR #33 merged; release and deployment evidence linked below). Rear-end multi-car chain-collision tuning and full Cocos Editor/device validation remain separate follow-up gates.


## Release 0.7.0 — 2026-10-31

- **Status:** released and merged to `main` as PR #32 (merge commit `dab62a69b35e57f7ccd8c2898895cbd1b43d947f`).
- **Visible browser changes:** adaptive lane-changing traffic; progressive localized soot; dark smoke and fire; one-shot explosion feedback; wreck burn/fade/despawn; explicit player destruction finish state.
- **Offline compatibility:** service-worker cache v18 includes `rigid-body-physics.js`, `traffic-ai.js`, and `vehicle-destruction.js` in addition to the existing app shell.
- **Verification:** PR #32 release CI run `41172188163` passed all 15 steps, including `npm test`, desktop/mobile Playwright smoke and gameplay preview upload. Merged-main validation run `41172531303` passed; GitHub Pages build/deployment run `41172530906` succeeded.
- **Limit:** Cocos Creator Editor/device runtime validation is not claimed by browser CI.
